The aim of this game is to reproduce a sequence of colors given by the programme. The program will display longer and longer chains of colors. The possible colors are blue, green, red and yellow.

The game begins when a sequence of three colors is displayed. While the sequence is displayed, the player cannot make any entries. If the sequence is complete, the player must repeat it using four buttons in the respective colors. If the answer is correct, another sequence is displayed which is one color longer.

Progress is indicated by a level indicator. If the sequence is incorrect, the level drops by one, as indicated by a message in the game window.
